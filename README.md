# 📦 DropZone

**DropZone** is an Android application designed to simplify the process of reporting and recovering lost items.  
It allows users to post **lost or found belongings** with details and images, helping the community efficiently reconnect owners with their items.

A key highlight of DropZone is its **AI-powered matching system**, which intelligently suggests relevant found items for lost posts using semantic similarity.

- Uses **cosine similarity** to rank matches
- Clicking a suggestion opens the matched found post directly

This significantly reduces manual searching and improves recovery chances.

## ⚠️ Note on AI Suggested Matches Feature

The **AI Suggested Matches** feature requires the AI backend to be running locally.

- The Android app communicates with a **FastAPI-based AI backend**
- If the backend is not running, the rest of the app works normally
- AI suggestions will simply not appear

### To enable AI matching:
1. Clone the AI backend repository  
2. Install the required Python dependencies  
3. Run the FastAPI server locally  
4. Ensure the backend URL is correctly configured in the Android app
